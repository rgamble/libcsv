[Installing on systems with make(1)]

On systems with make, the installation process consists of:

    ./configure
    make
    make check
    make install

You may need to run ldconfig or a similiar command before dynamically
linking your program to libcsv.

This will install the csv.h header, libcsv shared and static libraries,
and the csv(3) manual page.  Run ./configure --help for other options.

[Installing on systems without make]

libcsv is written in pure ANSI C89 and does not have any prerequisites aside
from a compiler and the Standard C library, it should compile on any
conforming implementation.  Below are examples of how to compile this on gcc,
see your compiler's documentation for other compilers.

libcsv can be installed as a shared library on systems that support it:
  gcc -shared libcsv.c -o libcsv.so

or simply compiled into object code an linked into your program:
  gcc libcsv.c -c -o libcsv.o
  gcc myproject.c libcsv.o -o myproject

you can also compile libcsv as a static library:
  gcc libcsv.c -c -o libcsv.o
  ar -rc libcsv.a libcsv.o
  ar -s libcsv.a


The examples can be compiled with gcc like this:
  gcc csvinfo.c libcsv.o -o csvinfo

or using a shared library like this:
  gcc csvinfo.c -lcsv -o csvinfo
